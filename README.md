# CapstoneMobileApplication
Tech: C#, JSON, API, SQLite.  Drafting Fantasy App Capstone, created with an azure connection which is currently not up and running due to cost and uses a free Fantasy Football API to grab data to display on the application. There is also a SQL lite local database implemented to store users and used Xamarin to build the android mobile side of the application with refactoring still needed to be completed due to learning Xamarin  for the first time and creating data models for JSON to be used throughout the application.
